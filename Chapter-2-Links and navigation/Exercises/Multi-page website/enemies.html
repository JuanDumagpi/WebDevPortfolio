        <p class="center">
            OK, hereâ€™s the reality: everything, on every planet, wants you dead. This is the life of a Helldiver. School yourself on the diabolical Terminids and the nefarious Automaton Collective.

    <h1>Terminids</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p class="center">
            The ravenous Terminids are guided solely by an instinctive urge to reproduce, spread, and destroy Democracy. They are a fast-evolving plague, a shapeshifting infestation that threatens to devour and disenfranchise every single child on every single planet. 
        </p>
    </div>   
    <h1>Automatons</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p class="center">
            The Automatons are mindless, bloodthirsty robots, coded for nothing but murder and socialist violence. Their origins are a mystery, but their unthinking hatred of Freedom makes them a threat to all citizens of Super Earth.
