    <h1>Fight for Super Earth!</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p class="center">
            Freedom. Peace. Managed Democracy. Your Super Earth-born rights. The key pillars of our civilization are under attack from deadly alien creatures conspiring to destroy your planet and its values.
        </p>
    </div>    
    <h1>Wield overpowered weapons!</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p class="center">
            Decide how to take down each enemy surge using a multitude of offensive and defensive tools. As you complete missions, you can upgrade your ship and build an even more impressive arsenal. Everything from shield generators, to turrets, to large-scale airstrikes can be used to give your team the upper-hand.
        </p>
    </div>   
    <h1>Aim carefully!</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p class="center">
            They say everything is better with friends, especially when it comes to raining destruction down on the enemies of Liberty! Be warned though: for maximum challenge and collaboration, friendly fire is always on. Communicate with your squad mates and make sure your arsenal only takes down your adversaries.

<h1>Know your enemy</h1>
<div class="box">
    <p class="center">
        OK, here’s the reality: everything, on every planet, wants you dead. This is the life of a Helldiver. School yourself on the diabolical Terminids and the nefarious Automaton Collective.
    </p>
</div>    
<h1>Terminids</h1>
<div class="box">
    <p class="center">
        The ravenous Terminids are guided solely by an instinctive urge to reproduce, spread, and destroy Democracy. They are a fast-evolving plague, a shapeshifting infestation that threatens to devour and disenfranchise every single child on every single planet. 
    </p>
</div>   
<h1>Automatons</h1>
<div class="box">
    <p class="center">
        The Automatons are mindless, bloodthirsty robots, coded for nothing but murder and socialist violence. Their origins are a mystery, but their unthinking hatred of Freedom makes them a threat to all citizens of Super Earth.

<h1>DualShockers</h1>

<p class="center">
    Helldivers 2 delivers a streamlined, premium experience, features some of the most satisfying space marine-style combat I've ever played.
    </p>

<h1>IGN</h1>
<div class="box"">
    <p class="center">
        Helldivers 2 is the rare modern multiplayer game that does almost everything right. It gives you a ton of freedom, feels fantastic to play, and has a smart progression system that doesn’t nickel and dime you or rely too much on a paid battle pass.

    <p class="center">
        Bombastic, funny and challenging, but still a bit buggy.
